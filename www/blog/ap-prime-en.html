<h2 class="title">On primes in some arithmetic progressions</h1>
</header>
<p>Let’s take a look on some funny stuff about arithmetic progressions
that envolve prime numbers in general.</p>
<p>First of all, some recaps and notations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A sequence <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a function
<span class="math inline">\(a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>. And a
subsequence of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a restriction
of its domain to an infinite set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}&#39; \subset
\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(a_{n+1} = a_{n}+r, r \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>. It
can also be written as <span class="math inline">\(a_{n+1}  =
A+nB, n \ge 0\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> being <span
class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> being <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. In this case, we will denote the set
of all values of <span class="math inline">\(a_{n}\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(\{A+nB\}_{n \ge 0}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We can also have finite sequences, if it is restricted to the
finite set <span class="math inline">\(I_{n}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(I_{n}=\{k \in \mathbb{N} \mid 1 \le k \le
n\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we will denote the set of all prime numbers as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From now on, we’ll consider APs with <span class="math inline">\(A,
B\)</span> and its values in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, since we’re addresing APs
that have prime values.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P} \setminus \{2n+1\}_{n \ge 0} =
\{2\}\)</span>, since no prime can be even, except for <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. So the sequence of all primes is, in
fact, a subsequence of <span class="math inline">\(a_{n+1} = 2n+1, n \ge
0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another cool thing: if we consider <span
class="math inline">\({an+b}_{n \ge 0}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(qcd(a, b)&gt;1\)</span>, this means that there is
some <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> that divides <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, so it divides <span
class="math inline">\(an+b\)</span>, so if <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is not prime, <span
class="math inline">\(an+b\)</span> is not also. In fact, the only case
where <span class="math inline">\(an+b\)</span> is prime is when <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is prime, so there is one prime at most
in <span class="math inline">\({an+b}_{n \ge 0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>At this point you may ask: “Could there be an AP (non-constant) that
<em>only</em> have primes?” The answer is no.</p>
<p>Assume that there is such a sequence <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(a_{1} =
p\)</span> is prime and every <span class="math inline">\(a_{n+1} =
a_{1}+(n-1)r = p+(n-1)r\)</span>, for some <span class="math inline">\(r
\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>.<br />
So if we take <span class="math inline">\(a_{p+1}\)</span>, we’ll get
<span class="math inline">\(a_{p+1} = p+(p+1-1)r = p+pr =
p(1+r)\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(a_{1} = p \mid
a_{p+1}\)</span>. Contradiction, since <span
class="math inline">\(a_{p+1} &gt; a_{1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a_{p+1}\)</span> is supposed to be prime.</p>
<p>Now moving to something more interesting, let’s go back to our <span
class="math inline">\(\{2n+1\}_{n \ge 0}\)</span> set. As we saw, it
contains an infinite amount of primes. Let’s test this for some other
AP, like <span class="math inline">\(a_{n+1} = 4n+3, n \ge 0\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{2}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(a_{3}\)</span> are examples of primes.</p>
<p>We start by assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\{4n+3\}_{n \ge
0} \bigcap \mathbb{P} = \{p_{i}\}, i \in I_{k}\)</span> for some <span
class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. In other words, we
assume the set of all prime terms of our sequence to be finite, aiming
for contradiction.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma 1</strong>: We have that <span
class="math inline">\((4a+1)(4b+1) = 16ab+4a+4b+1 =\)
\(4(4ab+a+b)+1\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\((4a+1)(4b+1)\)</span> has also the form <span
class="math inline">\(4c+1\)</span> for some <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let K be the product of all <span
class="math inline">\(p_{i}\)</span>’s in our set. So let’s take <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda = 4K-1 = 4(K-1)+3\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda&gt;1\)</span>, it has an unique prime
decomposition, so <span class="math inline">\(\lambda =
\prod\limits_{i=1}^{m}q_{i}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(q_{i} \in \mathbb{P}\)</span>, for some <span
class="math inline">\(m \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is in the form
<span class="math inline">\(4N+3\)</span>, some <span
class="math inline">\(q_{j}\)</span> is in the form <span
class="math inline">\(4N+3\)</span>, because if <span
class="math inline">\(q_{i}\)</span> were in the form <span
class="math inline">\(4N+1, \forall i \in I_{m}\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> would be in the form <span
class="math inline">\(4N+1\)</span> too (<em>Lemma 1</em>). So this
<span class="math inline">\(q_{j} \in \{p_{i}\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In fact, <span class="math inline">\(q_{j} \mid \lambda\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(q_{j} \mid K \implies q_{j} \mid 1\)</span>,
contradiction (<span class="math inline">\(q_{j} \neq 1\)</span>). So
there is no <span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(\{4n+3\}_{n \ge 0} \bigcap \mathbb{P} =
\{p_{i}\}, i \in I_{k}\)</span>. In other words, <span
class="math inline">\(\{4n+3\}_{n \ge 0}\)</span> has infinite
primes.</p>
<p>So, is there a way to generalize this fact and verify quickly whether
an AP contains infinite primes or not? Indeed there is. My goal is not
to show a formal proof of it, but to just show the theorem’s idea.</p>
<p>This theorem is called “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions"><em>Dirichlet’s
theorem on arithmetic progressions</em></a>”, and it states that if
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are coprime, the set <span
class="math inline">\(\{an+b\}_{n \ge 0}\)</span> has infinite primes.
It uses some Analytic Number Theory to do so, mainly trying to prove that
the sum of the reciprocals of the primes in this set diverges.</p>
<p>The idea of this fact is, naively saying, connect the divergence of
<span class="math inline">\(log\)</span> to that sum using the Riemann
Zeta function <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(s) = \prod\limits_{p \in
\mathbb{P}} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We basically have that <span class="math inline">\(log(\zeta(s)) =
\sum\limits_{p \in \mathbb{P}} -log(1-p^{-s})\) \(= \sum\limits_{p \in
\mathbb{P}, n \in \mathbb{N}} \frac{p^{-ns}}{n} = \sum\limits_{p \in
\mathbb{P}} \frac{1}{p^{s}} + O(1)\)</span>, with <span
class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> being some order 1 term. And indeed,
<span class="math inline">\(\lim\limits_{s \to 1^{+}} log(\zeta(s)) =
\infty\)</span>, which means that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span> is infinite (Euclid’s
Theorem).</p>
<p>Dirichlet extends this result with his “<em><span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> function</em>”, which uses an object
called “Dirichlet’s character” to restrict the sum of prime reciprocals
we got to some congruence class, obtaining <span
class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{p \in \mathbb{P} \bigcap \{an+b\}} \frac{1}{p^{s}} +
O(1)\)</span> from a function that envolves <span
class="math inline">\(log(L(\chi, s))\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> is the Dirichlet’s character.</p>
<p>Then the final idea is to prove that it diverges when <span
class="math inline">\(s \to 1\)</span>, so that this set <span
class="math inline">\(\{an+b\}_{n \ge 0}\)</span> is infinite (<a
href="https://math.rice.edu/~av15/Files/Dirichlet.pdf">see more about
it</a>).</p>
<p>As we saw, there is no infinite AP with <em>only</em> prime numbers,
but of course there are finite ones, like <span
class="math inline">\(\{6n+5\}_{n \in I_{5}}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\{30n+7\}_{n \in I_{6}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It was proven by Ben Green and Terence Tao in 2004 that there are in
fact finite APs containing only prime numbers with an arbitrary amount of
terms, even though you can’t construct them using this theorem, but only
prove their existence.</p>
<p>Currently, the largest finite AP containing only prime numbers known
is <span class="math inline">\(\{155368778·23\#n+605185576317848261\}_{n
\in I_{27}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k\#\)</span> is
defined as the product of all primes up to <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This sequence was found by the network
computing project PrimeGrid in 2023.</p>
<p>Explaining its proof is pretty much out of reach for me, so you can
read more about it <a

want.</p>
